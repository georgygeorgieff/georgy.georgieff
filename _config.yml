user_description: Current masters student at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Leeds School of Business where I am studying Business Analytics with a focus on Security. I graduated from Chestnut Hill College in 2013 with a Bachelors of Science in Accounting and completed my MBA with a concentration in Finance at Philadelphia University in 2015. During my MBA I worked at SEI Investments Company on the Angelo Gordon client as a fund accountant for alternative investments (bank debt and real estate). After leaving SEI, I joined Accenture as a Client Financial Management Analyst handling contractual finances from pricing, forecasting, presenting monthly financials and being the business advisor for client teams.
